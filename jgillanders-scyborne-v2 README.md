# Second version of my platformer game inspired by Bloodborne!
# This is a boss-rush gauntlet of sorts, while not finalized, it
# is the next version of the original platformer made in Construct 3!

# Controls: 
# Arrow Keys: Left/Right to move, Up to jump
# Space bar: Attack with your weapon! The hitbox can be a bit
# wonky, however it should work if you land it right. 

# Citations for assets that were NOT my own are listed here. In addition, the title screen
background was made with DALLE 3. 

# I used these assets from user “ansimuz” on https://opengameart.org/content/industrial-parallax-
background and https://opengameart.org/content/mountain-at-dusk-background
